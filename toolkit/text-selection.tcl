## Bindings for an advanced text selection system
## that works around the limitation of the 'sel' tag imposing either (if raised)
## the standard selection color, or (if lowered) leaving the background color
## unchanged.
## This system provides a mechanism that scans, whenever the selection changes,
## the selected text for tag ranges of tags that set background colors, and
## apply special tags (named like 'mytag#sel') on the intersection of the 'sel'
## tag and the normal markup tag.
## To enable the described mechanism for a given text widget, add the string
## "TextSelMechanism" to its bindtags.
## The 'mytag#sel' tags can be individually configured, before the text selection
## mechanism is triggered for the first time. If such a tag does not exist when
## the mechanism applies tags to the selected text range, the tag is automatically
## configured with a background color, calculated as an alpha-blended average
## between the original and the selection color (see ::tk_text::makeseltag).
## If you want to disable the blending mechanism for a certain tag, just create
## it with no configuration options, as in [.text tag configure mytag].
##
## Note:
## 1) You should always set the -selectbackground and -inactiveselectbackground
##    options of a text widget to the same color (don't set the selection color
##    only via the -background option of the 'sel' tag), because the #sel tags
##    don't synchronize to the changed selection color at focus-out, so the
##    "illusion" of an alpha-transparent selection would be lost.
## 2) If you have a tag with white or nearly white background color, you will
##    notice that the color chosen by the procedure ::tk_text::makeseltag will
##    be lighter than the selection outside of tags - this one is actually not
##    alpha-blended to the white widget background, because it is itself the
##    _source_ for alpha blending.
##    This "problem" has been considered a somewhat useful feature, since
##    it helps spotting ranges of tags with nearly invisible background colors
##    while selecting text. If you don't like it, either increase the alpha
##    opacity, or adjust the selection background to a blend of "pure selection
##    color" with white, after all the mytag#sel tags have been created.
##    (Don't rewrite the blending calculation on your own: Use a dummy tag,
##     set its background color to white, and calculate its selected color
##     with ::tk_text::makeseltag. Then set the -selectbackground attributes
##     from that color.)

# are issued; the first clears the selection, and the second creates the new
# selection â€” which is almost always identical to the one before it has been
# cleared.
# We store the last non-empty selection in a variable, and fire a 
# <<SelectionSettle>> event only when a new non-empty selection has been
# created, and when the selection is still empty after going into the idle loop.
