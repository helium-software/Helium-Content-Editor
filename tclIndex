# Tcl autoload index file, version 2.0
# This file has been generated by a make-tclIndex script and needs to
# be sourced (directly or by including this directory in auto_path)
# to set up indexing information for commands (array auto_index) and
# to make any namespaces known that contain those commands.
# When using auto_path, note that this file is not instantly sourced,
# but only when a not-yet-loaded procedure is called. You may want to
# source it directly to have all namespaces created (useful for plugin
# searching).

# Namespace creation follows

namespace eval ::tagsheet {}
namespace eval ::tcl::mathfunc {}

# Index of procedures follows

set auto_index(::tagsheet::evalsinglefile) [list source [file join $dir . tagsheet tagsheet.tcl]]
set auto_index(::tagsheet::init) [list source [file join $dir . tagsheet tagsheet.tcl]]
set auto_index(::tagsheet::evalfile) [list source [file join $dir . tagsheet tagsheet.tcl]]
set auto_index(::tcl::mathfunc::cond) [list source [file join $dir . math cond.tcl]]
